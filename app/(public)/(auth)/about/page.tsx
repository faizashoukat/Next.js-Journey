        <b>What is Next.Js?</b>
        <p>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React <br />
          Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations <br />
          Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, <br /> 
          like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead <br />
          of spending time with configuration.Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, <br />
           Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.</p>
